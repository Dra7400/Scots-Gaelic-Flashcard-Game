This flashcard game is designed to help you learn enough Gaelic to get by. 

Based on the reasoning that folows:

Your average professor, who is very eloquent, and fluent in any given language only knows about 10,000 words

and your average person probably only uses about 5,000 - 8,000

in their day to day lives. 

If you basically just want to get by in life,

you can pretty much rely on the 3000 words that an average teenager would know.

And finally, if you actually just want to be able to watch some simple movies,

read some simple books, maybe a newspaper then you could use the average kid vocabulary 

of about that the 1000 words.


But not just any 1000 random words will do.

There's such a thing as a frequency dictionary, a dictionary that's not listed in alphabetical order

but actually listed by the frequency that a particular word occurs in common usage. For example,

if you take the first 1000 words that are most commonly used,

then you can pretty much read most of the Newspapers,

you can watch most of the TV shows because these

are the words that are the bread and butter of the language. It's like in English,

the a, the, of, from, why, yes, no,

these are words that we use every day, again and again. You can get by without the crazy words

like anti-establishment or glioblastoma, etc. 

So this card game Randomly shows one of the top 1000 words in Gaelic. 

After about 3 seconds it shows you the same word in English so you know if you were correct.

You can click "yes" or "no" indicating whether or not you know the word. If you click "yes" the word is discarded.

If you click "no" it is added to a knew list of unknown words. This makes sure you spend time 

learning new words rather than the words you already know.
